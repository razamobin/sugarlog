x make form show on new page
x make new page post to new
x add post handler for new to just print post vals individually
x add logic to save hashes to redis
x test save, do many submits
x test sorting using cli
x iterate to fix any issues
x write sort in main func
x write a non-styled ui index page to get the entries
x markup
x style it somehow
(later) polish layouts etc
    x add link to new
    (later) add h1, style it
x set it up on ec2 instance
    x set up redis
    x put redis in fsync every second mode
    x set up code 
    x test it out

(continued) need to figure out automated deployment strategy 
    x make small change to python code
    x deploy it to server 
    x see if new change is live
    x if so great nope
    x if not, need to look into restarting uwsgi to reload the python code
        x ... just send HUP signal to master process

x need to figure out version control for app (probably github)
    x research a good hosted version control system - github public (free!)
    x set up the system (register, create repo, etc)
    x checkin current state of sugarlog

automate it (need to write pid to file)
    x learn about fabric
    x write a fabric file to fetch from version control (py file, templates dir, static dir), scp to server, HUP master process so children are restarted
    (later) restart uwsgi, and have it save master process pid to some standard location
    x test a few changes to the site (exciting !)
    x possibly combine git commit -a, and push origin master into fabfile (ask for user input on commit message)
    figure out why git output doesnt show up in fabric
    make a fabfile for setting up a brand new ubuntu instance with the production env
    add uwsgi.xml to git
    add a way to make production use a different config file (DEBUG = False)

add comments support - so i can make suggestions to dad (probably make it somewhat generic so we can make comments back and forth)

potential features:
add reply button so dad can answer any questions i make in my comments
add ability for me to highlight items in the list that are good, bad, neutral
mark blood sugar as good/bad
insert current time by default, add ability to enter manual time
can also add email/text message notifications for new posts
